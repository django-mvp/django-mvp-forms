# django-mvp-forms

A daisyUI template pack for django-crispy-forms, with form fields and widgets for django-mvp projects.

> **Status: pre-release.** The template pack draws text-like fields so far, and nothing is published to PyPI.

## Why

[django-mvp](https://github.com/django-mvp/django-mvp) renders its pages with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com), and its forms with [django-crispy-forms](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms). That leaves a gap: a crispy template pack that produces daisyUI markup and covers everything crispy-forms can lay out.

Two packs exist. [crispy-tailwind](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/crispy-tailwind) emits plain Tailwind utility classes, not daisyUI components, and has had no release since February 2024. [crispy-daisyui](https://github.com/fabge/crispy-daisyui) is a fork of it that its author describes as modified just enough for their own needs, with no test suite. Neither is a base we want django-mvp's form rendering to rest on, so this package provides a pack that is maintained alongside django-mvp and tested against the Django and daisyUI versions it supports.

## Scope & philosophy

The package covers how a form is drawn and what goes in it:

- a complete daisyUI template pack for django-crispy-forms, covering every layout object it ships
- formsets, drawn when one is handed to the pack
- form fields and widgets that have proved useful across django-mvp projects

It stays out of everything around the form. Form views, adding and removing formset rows, and form page templates belong to django-mvp. There are no models, no URLs and no migrations here.

The pack's templates are plain Django templates. They do not use [django-cotton](https://github.com/wrabit/django-cotton) or daisy-cotton, so the pack works in any daisyUI project, with or without django-mvp. For the same reason this package does not depend on django-mvp. The dependency runs the other way.

Fields and widgets are collected as real projects need them. They are not planned ahead and do not appear on the roadmap, so the set grows unevenly and that is intended. The package is complete without any of them, and each one has to fit the pack without changing what the pack promises.

Widgets from popular third-party Django packages may get templates here so they sit properly in a daisyUI form. Which packages are supported is the maintainers' call, and none of them becomes a dependency.

When two reasonable designs conflict, stock daisyUI markup wins over custom styling, and matching crispy-forms' documented behaviour wins over inventing a new one.

## Installation

```bash
pip install django-mvp-forms
```

Then add it to `INSTALLED_APPS` alongside crispy-forms:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "crispy_forms",
    "mvp_forms",
]
```

The host project supplies daisyUI itself. This package ships markup, not a stylesheet.

## Quickstart

Select the pack in your settings. Both settings are needed: crispy-forms refuses a pack that is not allowed.

```python
CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = ["daisyui"]
CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "daisyui"
```

Write a form as you always have:

```python
from django import forms


class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField()
    email = forms.EmailField()
    message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
```

Draw it in a template of a page that loads daisyUI:

```django
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}

<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form|crispy }}
</form>
```

## Public surface

### Template pack `daisyui`

Selected with the two settings above. Every field is drawn inside a daisyUI `fieldset` with a label and its input.

The label is tied to the input, and a required field's label carries a marker that assistive technology skips. The input announces itself as required, as invalid when it has errors, and by its help text and error messages as its description. Label, help text and errors are escaped unless you mark them safe. Every id the pack writes is built from the form's `auto_id`, so forms with different prefixes never share one, and a form with `auto_id=False` gets none.

These inputs are drawn as daisyUI components, whichever way crispy-forms is asked to draw the form (`|crispy`, `{% crispy form %}` or `|as_crispy_field`):

- text, email, URL, number, password, date, time and date-time inputs, as `input`
- textareas, as `textarea`

A class, placeholder, input type or row count you give a widget is kept. The pack never changes an input's type, so a date field is a text input unless its widget says otherwise. Fields with any other widget are still drawn in place, without a daisyUI class.
